# Leipzig Glossing in Typst

`leipzig-glossing` is a [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) library for
creating interlinear morpheme-by-morpheme glosses according to the [Leipzig
glossing rules](https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/pdf/Glossing-Rules.pdf).

Run `typst compile leipzig-gloss-examples.typ` in the root of the repository to
generate a pdf file with examples and documentation. This command is also
codified in the accompanying [justfile](https://github.com/casey/just) as `just
build-example`.
